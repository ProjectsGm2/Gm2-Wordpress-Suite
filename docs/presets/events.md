# Events Preset

## Custom Post Type

- **Slug:** `event`
- **Purpose:** Publishes event details with support for long-form content, featured imagery, and excerpts under `/events/` with a calendar icon in the admin menu.
- **Editor Template:** Uses a locked block group containing a heading, summary paragraph, and Elementor Template shortcode placeholder so editors can drop in a saved Elementor hero layout while preserving baseline structure.

## Taxonomies

| Taxonomy | Hierarchical | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `event_category` | Yes | Hierarchical categories organize events in archives (e.g., Workshop, Webinar). |
| `event_tag` | No | Flexible tagging surfaces keywords like `Networking` or `Virtual` for filtering. |

## Field Groups

### Event Details

| Field | Type | Validation & Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `start_date` | DateTime | Required start timestamp exposed in REST responses. |
| `end_date` | DateTime | Required end timestamp exposed in REST responses. |
| `location` | Text | Required venue or meeting details, also exposed through REST for maps. |

## Schema Mapping

- **Schema Type:** `Event`
- **Source:** [`presets/events/blueprint.json`](../../presets/events/blueprint.json) (`seo_mappings â†’ event`)

| Schema property | GM2 field slug |
| --- | --- |
| `startDate` | `start_date` |
| `endDate` | `end_date` |
| `eventStatus` | `status` |
| `eventAttendanceMode` | `attendance_mode` |
| `location.name` | `location` |
| `location.address.streetAddress` | `location` |
| `virtualLocation.url` | `virtual_event_url` |
| `onlineEventUrl` | `virtual_event_url` |
| `organizer` | `organizer` |
| `offers` | `ticket_offers` |

The `location` text feeds the `Place` name and street address, while linking an organizer post fills the `Organization` node. Adding rows to the `ticket_offers` repeater produces `Offer` objects with price, currency, and optional purchase URLs, and supplying a virtual event link populates a `VirtualLocation` alongside `onlineEventUrl` for all-online or hybrid sessions.

## Elementor Notes

Embed an Elementor design by filling in the `[elementor-template id=""]` placeholder. The locked group keeps the core heading and summary in place while letting Elementor control the hero or schedule layout.
