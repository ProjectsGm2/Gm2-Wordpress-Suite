== Description ==
A powerful suite of WordPress enhancements including admin tools, frontend optimizations, and ChatGPT-powered content generation.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/gm2-wordpress-suite` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Use the Gm2 Suite menu in the admin sidebar to configure settings. First
   visit **Gm2 → Google OAuth Setup** to enter your client ID and secret, then
   open **Gm2 → ChatGPT** to provide your OpenAI API key and choose a model from
   the dropdown.
   Finally, use **SEO → Connect Google Account** to authorize your Google account. After connecting, you will be able to select your Analytics Measurement ID and Ads Customer ID from dropdown menus.
4. All required PHP libraries, including the Google API client, are bundled in
   the plugin. No additional installation steps are required.
5. Follow the steps in the **Google integration** section below to copy your
   Search Console verification code and Google Ads developer token. These values
   cannot be fetched via API and must be entered manually on the SEO settings
   page.
6. Select your Analytics Measurement ID and Ads Customer ID on the
   **SEO → Connect Google Account** page after connecting. These IDs cannot be
   entered manually on the SEO settings screen.

If you plan to distribute or manually upload the plugin, you can create a ZIP
archive with `bash bin/build-plugin.sh`. This command packages the plugin with
all dependencies into `gm2-wordpress-suite.zip` for installation via the
**Plugins → Add New** screen.

== Google integration ==
These credentials must be copied from your Google accounts:

* **Search Console verification code** – Log in to <https://search.google.com/search-console>, open **Settings → Ownership verification**, and choose the *HTML tag* option. Copy the code displayed in the meta tag and paste it into the **Search Console Verification Code** field on the SEO settings page. See <https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9008080> for details.
* **Google Ads developer token** – Sign in at <https://ads.google.com>, then go to **Tools → API Center**. Copy your **Developer token** and enter it into the **Google Ads Developer Token** field. Documentation: <https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/first-call/dev-token>.

== Breadcrumbs ==
Display a breadcrumb trail anywhere using the `[gm2_breadcrumbs]` shortcode. The output
is an ordered list wrapped in a `<nav>` element with accompanying JSON-LD for search engines.
You can enable automatic breadcrumbs in the footer from **SEO → Schema**.

== Caching ==
Enable HTML, CSS, and JavaScript minification from the SEO &gt; Performance
screen. To enable these options:

1. Navigate to **SEO → Performance** in your WordPress admin area.
2. Check **Minify HTML**, **Minify CSS**, and **Minify JS** as desired.
3. Click **Save Settings**.

For full page caching, hook into the `gm2_set_cache_headers` action
to configure headers or integrate your preferred caching plugin.

== Keyword Research ==
After configuring credentials in **Gm2 → Google OAuth Setup**, connect your Google account from **SEO → Connect Google Account**. The plugin automatically fetches your available Analytics Measurement IDs and Ads Customer IDs so you can select them from dropdown menus. Use the **Keyword Research** tab to generate ideas via the Google Keyword Planner.

== Image Optimization ==
Enter your compression API key and enable the service from the SEO &gt; Performance screen.
When enabled, uploaded images are sent to the API and replaced with the optimized result.

== ChatGPT ==
Configure the integration from **Gm2 → ChatGPT** in your WordPress admin area. Enter your
OpenAI API key and adjust these options:

* **Model** – select the model to use from a dropdown. Options are fetched from
  OpenAI when possible (defaults to `gpt-3.5-turbo`).
* **Temperature** – controls randomness of responses.
* **Max Tokens** – optional limit on the length of completions.
* **API Endpoint** – URL of the chat completions API.

Use the **Test Prompt** box on the same page to send a message and verify your
settings before generating content.
