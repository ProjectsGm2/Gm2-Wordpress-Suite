== Installation ==
1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/gm2-wordpress-suite` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Use the Gm2 Suite menu in the admin sidebar to configure settings. First
   visit **Gm2 → Google OAuth Setup** to enter your client ID and secret, then
   open **Gm2 → AI Settings** to choose an AI provider (ChatGPT, Gemma, or Llama) and supply the corresponding API key and endpoint.
   Finally, use **SEO → Connect Google Account** to authorize your Google account. After connecting, you will be able to select your Analytics Measurement ID and Ads Customer ID from dropdown menus.
4. The plugin relies on WordPress's built-in HTTP API and has no external
   dependencies.
5. Ensure the PHP DOM/LibXML extension is installed. Without it, HTML analysis
   and AI research features will be unavailable.
6. Follow the steps in the **Google integration** section below to copy your
   Search Console verification code and Google Ads developer token. These values
   cannot be fetched via API and must be entered manually on the SEO settings
   page.
7. Select your Analytics Measurement ID and Ads Customer ID on the
   **SEO → Connect Google Account** page after connecting, or enter them
   manually on the SEO settings screen if needed.
8. Install and activate WooCommerce (required for Quantity Discounts and Abandoned Carts).
9. Install and activate Elementor to use the Gm2 Qnty Discounts widget on product pages and the Registration/Login widget. With Elementor Pro the discount widget appears in the **WooCommerce** section when editing Single Product templates. Otherwise look under **General**.
10. Open **Gm2 → Quantity Discounts** and create discount groups to define pricing rules.
11. Configure cart recovery options under **Gm2 → Abandoned Carts**.
12. Choose an Elementor popup on **Gm2 → Cart Settings** to collect a shopper's email or phone before leaving. Captured contact details appear on the **Gm2 → Abandoned Carts** page.

**Note:** WooCommerce and Elementor Pro must be active. Elementor 3.5+ is recommended and older versions are supported with a fallback.

If you plan to distribute or manually upload the plugin, you can create a ZIP
archive with `bash bin/build-plugin.sh`. This command packages the plugin with
all dependencies into `gm2-wordpress-suite.zip` for installation via the
**Plugins → Add New** screen.
== Setup Wizard ==
After activation the **Gm2 Setup Wizard** (`index.php?page=gm2-setup-wizard`) opens once to walk through entering your AI provider API key, Google OAuth credentials, sitemap settings and which modules to enable. The wizard is optional and can be launched again from the **Gm2 Suite** dashboard at any time.


== Feature Toggles ==
The main **Gm2 Suite** page lets administrators enable or disable major modules.
Check or uncheck **Tariff**, **SEO**, **Quantity Discounts**, **Google OAuth Setup**,
**ChatGPT**, or **Abandoned Carts** and click *Save* to hide their menus and functionality. All
features are enabled by default.

== Cache Audit ==
Open **SEO → Performance → Cache Audit** to review caching headers for front-end assets.
The page scans the homepage and enqueued scripts and styles, issuing `HEAD` requests
to record TTL, `Cache-Control`, `ETag`, `Last-Modified` and size for scripts, styles,
images, fonts and other resources. Assets are marked *Needs Attention* when they:

* lack a `Cache-Control` header,
* use a `max-age` under seven days,
* include a version query without `immutable`, or
* omit both `ETag` and `Last-Modified`.

Filter by asset type, host or status, click **Re-scan** to run the scan again or
**Export CSV** to download `gm2-cache-audit.csv`. Network administrators can select
individual sites from the Network Admin and audit each separately. Access requires
`manage_options` (`manage_network` on multisite). Results, including the last run
timestamp, are stored in the `gm2_cache_audit_results` option.

The screen also includes a quick shell panel with copy-ready checks:

```
curl -I https://example.com/wp-includes/js/jquery/jquery.min.js
```

Verify the `Cache-Control` header and, for repeat-view testing, keep **Disable cache**
unchecked in DevTools, hard reload the page and confirm the file loads from disk cache.

== Render Optimizer ==
Enable performance modules from **SEO → Performance → Render Optimizer**. Available options include:

* Critical CSS with allow/deny lists and optional manual overrides.
* JavaScript deferral with dependency awareness plus allow and deny lists.
* Differential serving of modern and legacy JavaScript bundles.
* Combination and minification of local CSS and JS assets.

=== Critical CSS ===
Inline above-the-fold styles and load full stylesheets asynchronously.

* Strategies:
  * `per_home_archive_single` – store snippets for the home page, archive templates and each post type.
  * `per_url_cache` – hash the current URL for page-specific CSS.
* Async methods:
  * `preload_onload` – outputs a `<link rel="preload">` tag that swaps to `rel="stylesheet"` with a `<noscript>` fallback.
  * `media_print` – starts with `media="print"` and switches to `all` on load.
* Exclusions – provide handles to skip; editor, dashicons, admin-bar and WooCommerce inline styles are ignored automatically.
* Purge workflow – click **Purge Critical CSS** on the Render Optimizer screen to clear stored snippets after theme or style changes.

If WP Rocket, Autoptimize, Perfmatters or other optimizer plugins are active, the subsystem automatically disables its features and displays a warning. Only one optimization plugin should run at a time.

== SEO Performance CLI ==
Run `wp seo-perf` commands to audit your site and manage caching headers.

* `wp seo-perf audit` – Runs an AI-powered audit and prints JSON
  recommendations.
* `wp seo-perf apply-htaccess` – Writes cache headers into `.htaccess`.
* `wp seo-perf generate-nginx` – Generates an Nginx include file with caching
  rules.
* `wp seo-perf clear-markers` – Removes `.htaccess` markers and the Nginx file.

Example:

```
wp seo-perf audit > report.json
wp seo-perf apply-htaccess
wp seo-perf generate-nginx
wp seo-perf clear-markers
```

`audit` prints a JSON object such as:

```
{
    "issues": ["Missing Cache-Control on images"],
    "recommendations": ["Add long-lived headers for static assets"]
}
```

All commands work in multisite. Use `--url=<site>` to target a specific site.

Exit codes:

* audit: `0` success, `1` missing AI utilities or an error code from AI
* apply-htaccess: `0` success, `1` unsupported server, `2` CDN already sets headers, `3` `.htaccess` not writable, `4` unknown result
* generate-nginx: `0` success, `1` unsupported server, `2` CDN already sets headers, `3` directory not writable, `4` unknown result
* clear-markers: `0` success, `1` could not remove generated file

A non-zero exit code indicates failure. Review the message to resolve
permission or server issues before retrying.

== Script Attributes ==
Control how front-end scripts load from **SEO → Performance → Script Loading**.
Assign **Blocking**, **Defer**, or **Async** per handle. Handles default to
`defer`, but the plugin evaluates dependencies so a handle becomes blocking if
any dependency is blocking, and it drops its attribute when a dependency is
`async` or otherwise non-deferred.

Presets help configure common setups:

* **Defer all third-party** – marks WordPress core handles as blocking and
  defers everything else.
* **Conservative** – only marks core handles as blocking; other scripts fall
  back to the default `defer`.

Scripts using `document.write` or requiring synchronous execution should remain
blocking, since deferring them can break output or analytics tags.

== Google integration ==
These credentials must be copied from your Google accounts:

* **Search Console verification code** – Log in to <https://search.google.com/search-console>, open **Settings → Ownership verification**, and choose the *HTML tag* option. Copy the code displayed in the meta tag and paste it into the **Search Console Verification Code** field on the SEO settings page. See <https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9008080> for details.
* **Google Ads developer token** – Sign in at <https://ads.google.com/aw/apicenter> and open **Tools & Settings → Setup → API Center** (manager account required). Copy your **Developer token** and enter it into the **Google Ads Developer Token** field. Documentation: <https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/first-call/dev-token>.
* **Google Ads login customer ID** – Optional manager account ID associated with your developer token. Enter this value if the token belongs to a manager account so requests include the `login-customer-id` header.
* **Google Ads API version** – The plugin uses the API version defined by the `Gm2_Google_OAuth::GOOGLE_ADS_API_VERSION` constant (default `v18`). Update this constant and any tests referencing it when a new Ads API version becomes available.
* **Analytics Admin API version** – The GA4 endpoints use the version specified by `Gm2_Google_OAuth::ANALYTICS_ADMIN_API_VERSION` (default `v1beta`). Update this constant along with related tests when Google releases a new version.
* **Automatic redirect URI registration** – Enter your Google Cloud Project ID and Service Account JSON path on the **Google OAuth Setup** page (or define `GM2_GCLOUD_PROJECT_ID` and `GM2_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` in `wp-config.php`). The plugin uses these values to add the current site's redirect URI to the OAuth client via the Google Cloud API.

== Troubleshooting ==
If you see errors when connecting your Google account:

* **Missing developer token** – Sign in at <https://ads.google.com/aw/apicenter> and open **Tools & Settings → Setup → API Center** (manager account required). Copy your **Developer token** and enter it in the **Google Ads Developer Token** field on the SEO settings page.
* **No Analytics properties found** or **No Ads accounts found** –
  * Enable the Analytics Admin, Google Analytics (v3) for UA properties, Search Console, and Google Ads APIs for your OAuth client.
  * Confirm the connected Google account can access the required properties and accounts. The OAuth client can belong to a different Google account.
  * Disconnect and reconnect after adjusting permissions.
* **Invalid OAuth state** – Reconnect from **SEO → Connect Google Account** to refresh the authorization flow.
* **Keyword Research returns no results** – Ensure you have entered your Google Ads developer token, connected a Google account with Ads access, and selected a valid Ads customer ID. When these details are missing or the Keyword Planner request fails, the plugin now falls back to ChatGPT and displays a notice that metrics are unavailable.
* **Google Ads API did not return keyword metrics** – The Keyword Planner may return keyword ideas without search volume data. AI Research still analyzes the top results and displays a notice when metrics are missing. Verify the selected Ads account and date range have sufficient data.
* "The caller does not have permission" – This usually means your developer token isn't approved for the selected Ads account or the login customer ID is missing or incorrect. Verify the token status in the Google Ads API Center and ensure the OAuth account can access that customer ID.
* **Testing with an unapproved token** – Unapproved developer tokens can be used with [Google Ads test accounts](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/best-practices/test-accounts). The login customer ID must be the manager ID for that token, and test accounts don't serve ads and have limited features.
* **Viewing debug logs** – Add `define('WP_DEBUG', true);` and `define('WP_DEBUG_LOG', true);` to your `wp-config.php` file, then check `wp-content/debug.log` for errors.
* **Check DOM extension** – Run `php -m | grep -i dom` to verify the DOM/LibXML extension is loaded. The plugin requires this for HTML analysis.
* **Gm2 Qnty Discounts widget missing** – Ensure Elementor is active and loads before this plugin, or deactivate and reactivate plugins so Elementor triggers the `elementor/loaded` action.
* **Leftover SEO conflict warning** – Re-save the **Gm2 Suite** settings or update to version 1.6.16 or higher to clear outdated notices.

=== WP Debugging ===
If AI Research fails or returns unexpected results, enable WordPress debugging and check for PHP errors:

1. Edit your `wp-config.php` file and add:
   `define('WP_DEBUG', true);`
   `define('WP_DEBUG_LOG', true);`
2. Retry the request and examine `wp-content/debug.log` for error messages.

The AI features depend on the DOM/LibXML extension. Verify it is installed by running `php -m | grep -i dom` before using AI Research.

== Diagnostics ==
As a first step, open **Gm2 → Diagnostics** to detect plugin conflicts, missing files or theme customizations that may disable SEO output. Any detected issues are listed as an admin notice with steps to resolve them. Diagnostics run only when the SEO module is enabled on the **Gm2 Suite** page.

== Site Health ==
Open **Tools → Site Health** to run these diagnostics automatically. The Gm2 Suite section lists any conflicts, missing plugin files or removed theme hooks with recommended steps to resolve them.

== Breadcrumbs ==
Display a breadcrumb trail anywhere using the `[gm2_breadcrumbs]` shortcode. The output
is an ordered list wrapped in a `<nav>` element with accompanying JSON-LD for search engines.
You can enable automatic breadcrumbs in the footer from **SEO → Schema**.

== Caching ==
Enable HTML, CSS, and JavaScript minification from the SEO &gt; Performance
screen. To enable these options:

1. Navigate to **SEO → Performance** in your WordPress admin area.
2. Check **Minify HTML**, **Minify CSS**, and **Minify JS** as desired.
3. Click **Save Settings**.

For full page caching, hook into the `gm2_set_cache_headers` action
to configure headers or integrate your preferred caching plugin.

== Remote Mirror ==
Enable local copies of tracking scripts from **SEO → Performance → Remote Mirror**.
Check **Facebook Pixel** or **Google gtag** to mirror those vendors. You can also
enter custom script URLs—such as your own CDN—one per line to mirror additional
files. Each mirrored script lists its SHA-256 hash for optional SRI attributes, and
the cache refreshes daily via WP-Cron.

== Keyword Research ==
After configuring credentials in **Gm2 → Google OAuth Setup**, connect your Google account from **SEO → Connect Google Account**. The plugin automatically fetches your available Analytics Measurement IDs and Ads Customer IDs so you can select them from dropdown menus. Use the **Keyword Research** tab or the AI SEO workflow to generate ideas via the Google Keyword Planner. To fetch keywords you must enter a Google Ads developer token, connect a Google account with Ads access, and select a valid Ads customer ID (without dashes, e.g., `1234567890`). Missing or invalid credentials will result in empty or failed searches. If your developer token belongs to a manager account, provide the optional Login Customer ID so the value is sent with each request.

Keyword metrics include **Avg. Monthly Searches**, **competition**, **3‑month change** and **year-over-year change**. These values refine the seed keywords returned by ChatGPT and are sorted by popularity when displayed in the AI SEO modal.

The Google Ads request also requires a language constant and a geo target constant. These values are configurable on the same screen and default to `languageConstants/1000` (English) and `geoTargetConstants/2840` (United States). If either option is missing or invalid, the keyword search will fail with an error.

== Analytics ==
After connecting a Google account, open the **Analytics** tab under SEO (`admin.php?page=gm2-seo&tab=analytics`). Line and bar charts powered by Chart.js display sessions, bounce rate and top search queries. Select an Analytics property and Search Console site on the **Connect Google Account** screen before viewing the charts.

== Google Merchant Centre ==
The plugin tracks real-time product updates for Google Merchant Centre. Price, availability and inventory changes are cached and exposed through the REST endpoint `/gm2/v1/gmc/realtime`. A front-end script polls this endpoint and dispatches a `gm2GmcRealtimeUpdate` event with the latest values.

Configuration:
1. Ensure the WordPress REST API is accessible on your site.
2. Listen for the `gm2GmcRealtimeUpdate` event in custom scripts to react to updates.
3. Use the `gm2_gmc_realtime_fields` filter to adjust which fields trigger updates.

== Image Optimization ==
Enter your compression API key and enable the service from the SEO &gt; Performance screen.
When enabled, uploaded images are sent to the API and replaced with the optimized result.

== AI Providers ==
Select your preferred AI service from **Gm2 → AI Settings**. Choose between **ChatGPT**, **Gemma**, or **Llama** and enter the required API key and endpoint.

When **ChatGPT** is selected you can also configure:

* **Model** – defaults to `gpt-3.5-turbo`.
* **Temperature** – controls randomness of responses.
* **Max Tokens** – optional limit on the length of completions.
* **API Endpoint** – URL of the chat completions API.

Use the **Test Prompt** box on the same page (available for ChatGPT) to send a message and verify your
settings before generating content.

== SEO Guidelines ==
Use **SEO → SEO Guidelines** to define rule sets for each post type and taxonomy.
Click **AI Research Guideline Rules** to have ChatGPT suggest best-practice rules
for the selected content type. Saved rules are stored in the `gm2_guideline_rules`
option and are combined automatically when generating AI content.

== Content Rules ==
Open the **Rules** tab under **SEO** to define checks for each post type and
taxonomy. Rules are grouped into categories like *SEO Title*, *SEO Description*,
*Focus Keywords*, *Long Tail Keywords*, *Canonical URL*, *Content* and
*General*. Each category provides its own textarea where you can enter multiple
line-based rules. These category rules work alongside the text in **SEO
Guidelines** and are considered when running **AI Research** on a post or
taxonomy term.

Within the Rules table, each post type or taxonomy row now includes a single
**AI Research Content Rules** button positioned beneath all of its category
textareas. Click this button to fetch best-practice suggestions from ChatGPT for
the selected content type. ChatGPT is told which content type is being analyzed
and instructed to
return an array of short, measurable rules for each requested category. Each
array should contain exactly 5 concise guidelines that are easy to verify within the final content. Focus and long-tail keyword entries
should describe how to research or choose keywords rather than listing any
specific phrases. The results are saved automatically so you can refine them at
any time. ChatGPT is instructed to respond **only with JSON** where each key
matches one of the slugs you provided and each value is an array of rules.

Category names returned by ChatGPT may contain spaces or hyphens. These are
normalized to use underscores when saving so keys like "SEO Title" or
"seo-title" populate the `seo_title` textarea.
Synonyms such as "content in post" or "content in product" will also populate
the `content` category automatically.

Example JSON response:

```
{
  "seo_title": [
    "Use the main keyword first",
    "Keep under 60 characters"
  ],
  "seo_description": [
    "Summarize the page in under 160 characters",
    "Include a call to action"
  ]
}
```

== SEO Context ==
Open the **Context** tab under **SEO** to store detailed business information used in AI prompts. Answer each question and the plugin will append your responses to every AI request:

* **Business Model** – How does the company make money (product sales, services, subscriptions, ads, affiliate, hybrid)?
* **Industry Category** – Which industry best describes your business? If e-commerce, list main product categories and any flagship items. For services or SaaS, outline your core offerings and modules.
* **Target Audience** – Who are your core customer segments and where are they located?
* **Unique Selling Points** – What differentiates your brand from competitors in terms of price, quality, experience, or mission?
* **Revenue Streams** – List the major sources of revenue such as products, services, subscriptions or ads.
* **Primary Goal** – What is the website's main objective?
* **Brand Voice** – Describe the desired style or tone (professional, casual, luxury, authoritative, playful, eco-friendly, etc.).
* **Competitors** – List main online competitors and what makes your offer stronger or unique.
* **Core Offerings** – What are the key products or services you provide?
* **Geographic Focus** – Which regions or locations do you primarily target?
* **Keyword Data** – Do you have existing keyword research or rankings to share?
* **Competitor Landscape** – How would you describe the competitive landscape in your niche?
* **Success Metrics** – Which KPIs will track SEO success (sales, leads, traffic, rankings)?
* **Buyer Personas** – Describe your ideal buyers and their pain points.
* **Project Description** – Short summary of your project or website. Used when other fields are empty.
* **Custom Prompts** – Default instructions appended to AI requests.
* **Business Context Prompt** – One-click builder that combines your answers into a single prompt summarizing the business.

To build the prompt, ensure your chosen AI provider is enabled and the API key saved under **Gm2 → AI Settings**. Then return to **SEO → Context** and click **Generate AI Prompt** below the Business Context Prompt field. The plugin merges all of your Context answers and sends them to the selected provider. The response is inserted into the textarea so you can tweak it before saving.

== SEO Settings ==
The SEO meta box appears when editing posts, pages, any public custom post types and taxonomy terms. In the
**SEO Settings** tab you can enter a custom title and description, focus keywords and long tail keywords, toggle
`noindex` or `nofollow`, and upload an Open Graph image. Focus and long tail keywords are combined into a `<meta name="keywords">` tag on the front end. Click **Select Image**
to open the WordPress media library and choose a picture for the `og:image` and
`twitter:image` tags. When inserting a link, you can pick `nofollow` or `sponsored`
from the link dialog and the plugin will automatically apply the attribute.

Use the **Max Snippet**, **Max Image Preview**, and **Max Video Preview** fields
to control how search engines display your content. Values entered here are
added to the robots meta tag.

The **Sitemap** tab lets you regenerate your XML sitemap. Each time a sitemap is
created, the plugin pings Google and Bing so they can re-crawl it. The sitemap is
written to `sitemap.xml` in your WordPress directory by default. This path can be
changed via the **Sitemap Path** field. You can also edit your robots file from
**SEO → Robots.txt**.

Enable **Clean Slugs** from **SEO → General** to strip stopwords from new
permalinks. Enter the words to remove in the accompanying field.
== Managing SEO Settings ==
The bottom of the main **SEO** page (`admin.php?page=gm2-seo`) includes advanced tools:
* **Export Settings** – download a `gm2-seo-settings.json` file with all options starting with `gm2_`.
* **Import Settings** – upload the same JSON format to restore or migrate settings.
* **Reset to Defaults** – revert all SEO options to their original values.
Only administrators can perform these actions.


== AI SEO ==
While editing a post or taxonomy term, open the **AI SEO** tab in the SEO meta box. Click **AI Research** to run a two-step workflow. You'll first be asked whether to use any existing SEO field values. If all fields are empty and no site context is set under **SEO → Context**, you'll be prompted for a short description so ChatGPT has extra context. Answers saved in the Context tab are automatically included in each prompt, so you only need to provide extra details when those fields are empty.

Step one sends the post content to ChatGPT which returns a title, description
and a list of seed keywords. If no seed keywords are returned, the plugin
generates them automatically before querying Google Ads. Step two refines those keywords with the Google
Keyword Planner, ranking them by **Avg. Monthly Searches**, **competition** and
the **3‑month** and **year-over-year change** metrics. A valid Google Ads
developer token, connected account and customer ID are required for this step.
If these credentials are missing or the Keyword Planner fails, AI SEO falls back
to the ChatGPT suggestions and adds a notice that metrics are unavailable.

The results suggest a title, description, focus keywords, canonical URL, page
name and slug. Any detected HTML issues—such as multiple `<h1>` tags—are listed
with optional fixes. Use the **Select all** checkbox to implement the results
and automatically populate the SEO fields.

If the description field in the SEO Settings tab is left empty, the plugin sends
an excerpt of the post to ChatGPT and uses the response as the meta description.
Enabling **Auto-fill missing alt text** under **SEO → Performance** also uses
ChatGPT to generate alt text for new images when none is provided. Enable
**Clean Image Filenames** in the same section to automatically rename uploads
using a sanitized version of the attachment title.
On taxonomy edit screens you'll also find a **Generate Description** button next
to the description field. The prompt can be customised via the
`gm2_tax_desc_prompt` setting. The prompt automatically notes whether the term is a post
category, product category or other custom taxonomy. Any existing SEO field
values are cleaned before being sent to ChatGPT.


The SEO Settings tab also lets you set `max-snippet`, `max-image-preview`, and
`max-video-preview` values that will be added to the robots meta tag.
== Bulk AI ==
The **Bulk AI Review** page (`admin.php?page=gm2-bulk-ai-review`) lets you analyze many posts at once. Select posts and click **Schedule Batch** to queue them. WP‐Cron runs the `gm2_ai_batch_process` event hourly to fetch suggestions in the background. Ensure ChatGPT and Ads credentials are configured before scheduling.


== Structured Data ==
Enable **Article Schema** from **SEO → Schema** to output Schema.org Article
markup on posts. The markup includes the headline, author and publication date
and helps search engines understand your content.

== Tariff Management ==
Manage percentage-based fees for WooCommerce orders. Open **Gm2 → Tariff** to
add or edit tariffs. Enabled tariffs add a fee to the cart total during
checkout.

== Quantity Discounts ==
This feature requires WooCommerce to be active.
After activating WooCommerce, open **Gm2 → Quantity Discounts** and click **Add Discount Group** to define bulk pricing rules. Choose the products or categories to apply, enter the minimum quantity and specify either a percentage or fixed discount. When customers meet the threshold the discount is applied automatically in the cart. Install Elementor to add the **Gm2 Qnty Discounts** widget on product pages, giving shoppers buttons for preset quantities that match your rules. If Elementor Pro is active the widget lives in the **WooCommerce** section; otherwise it appears in **General**. The selected rule and discounted price are saved in order item meta and appear in emails and on the admin order screen.

== Abandoned Carts ==
Enable this module from **Gm2 → Dashboard**. The first time it runs the plugin creates four tables—`wp_wc_ac_carts`, `wp_wc_ac_email_queue`, `wp_wc_ac_recovered` and `wp_wc_ac_cart_activity`—to store cart sessions, queued messages, recovered orders and item‑level activity. A JavaScript snippet captures the shopper’s email on the checkout page, tracks browsing, and flags carts as abandoned when the last tab closes.

The **Gm2 → Abandoned Carts** screen groups entries by IP address so multiple visits from the same shopper appear as a single row showing the latest cart value along with total browsing time and revisits. Click a row’s **Cart Activity Log** link to view the add/remove/quantity events and revisit entry/exit actions recorded for that IP. Visit entries include the returning IP address plus entry and exit URLs with timestamps for each session.

Activity pings that mark carts as active are throttled to one request every 30 seconds by default. Developers can adjust this interval with the `gm2_ac_active_interval_ms` filter.

Developers can customize the inactivity window with the `gm2_ac_mark_abandoned_interval` filter and send recovery emails by hooking into `gm2_ac_send_message` when the hourly `gm2_ac_process_queue` task runs. A default handler, `gm2_ac_send_default_email`, sends a simple WooCommerce email via `wp_mail`. Disable it with `remove_action( 'gm2_ac_send_message', 'Gm2\\gm2_ac_send_default_email' )` or customize the message with the `gm2_ac_default_email_subject` and `gm2_ac_default_email_body` filters.

== Redirects ==
Create 301 or 302 redirects from the **SEO → Redirects** tab. The plugin logs
the last 100 missing URLs to help you create new redirects.

== Planned Features ==
* **Search Console metrics** – the **SEO → Analytics** tab shows clicks and impressions from connected sites.
* **Expanded rules** – guideline rules for each content type editable under
  **SEO → SEO Guidelines**.
* **Duplicate checks** – upcoming report in **SEO → Tools** that flags posts
  with duplicate titles or descriptions.
* **Slug cleanup** – bulk action in **SEO → General** or from the posts list to
  remove stopwords from existing slugs.
* **Canonical for variations** – meta box option to set a canonical URL on
  individual product variations.
* **Image alt keyword checks** – SEO meta box warning when alt text is missing
  or lacks the focus keyword.
* **Link count tracking** – post list columns showing internal and external
  link counts with a totals widget.
* **PageSpeed** – run Google PageSpeed tests from a new **Performance →
  PageSpeed** screen.
* **Taxonomy intro length enforcement** – minimum description length setting
  under **SEO → Taxonomies**.
* **AI-generated taxonomy descriptions** – generate term descriptions via an
  **AI SEO** button on taxonomy edit screens.
* **Image filename normalization** – automatically sanitize filenames when
  **Clean Image Filenames** is enabled.
* **Bulk AI suggestions** – bulk action on the posts list to generate AI SEO
  suggestions for multiple items with post type and category filters.
* **Outbound link rel controls** – dropdown in the link dialog to apply
  `nofollow` or `sponsored` to outbound links.
* **Accessible tabs** – admin tabs use ARIA roles and keyboard controls for
  better accessibility.
* **Spinner during AI SEO research** – provides feedback while requests run.
* **Field placeholders and tooltips** – SEO inputs offer guidance and context.
* **Real-time snippet preview** – view how titles and descriptions appear in
  search results as you type.
* **Test Connection button** – quickly confirm Google integration on the
  connect screen.

== Testing ==
The PHPUnit tests rely on the WordPress test suite and the `phpunit` executable.


1. **Install PHP and Composer.** PHPUnit is required for the tests and can be installed globally:
   ```bash
   composer global require phpunit/phpunit
   ```
   Ensure the Composer global bin directory is on your `PATH`.
2. **Install the WordPress test suite.** Run the helper script before executing the tests:
   ```bash
   bash bin/install-wp-tests.sh <db-name> <db-user> <db-pass> [db-host] [wp-version]
   ```
   This downloads WordPress and prepares the test database.
3. **Run the tests.** Execute `phpunit` or `make test` from the project root. The Makefile will install the test suite automatically if it is missing. Set `WP_TESTS_DIR` if you installed the suite elsewhere.

The tests cover the AJAX endpoints used for content analysis and AI research (`gm2_check_rules`, `gm2_keyword_ideas`, `gm2_research_guidelines` and `gm2_ai_research`).

JavaScript tests reside in `tests/js` and use Jest. Install Node dependencies
and run them with:

```
npm install
npm test
```

== Privacy ==

This plugin logs page visits and events to a custom table. IP addresses are anonymized before storage by truncating the final octet of IPv4 addresses (and the equivalent segment for IPv6) using WordPress's `wp_privacy_anonymize_ip()` function. No full IP addresses are retained.
