# Agent Guidelines

- Review `CODE_REVIEW.md` and `TASKS.md` before making any changes to understand open issues and assigned follow-up work.
- Prefer implementing solutions that align with the actionable items recorded in `TASKS.md`; update the checklist when completing a task.
- Document significant deviations from the tasks directly in commit messages and PR summaries so reviewers know why a change was necessary.
